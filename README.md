Love to know - Unity Dev Test

In the repository you could find the complete unity test (2020 lts) as well as the android build.
I've copied the json you provided as exaple at the pdf and added an option at the app to use it as source info for the crossword generator.
You can check/uncheck that option to use the example json or just create a new one based on the requirements at the pdf. 
You can also upload any compatible json (with the same parameters as the expample you provided) and use it at the app.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate on asking them by email to:

Thanks !
